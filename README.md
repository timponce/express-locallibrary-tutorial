## Project Summary

This web app has the basic capabilities neccessary to manage the catalog of a library of books.

Following instructions from The Odin Project and a detailed tutorial from MDN Web Docs, I learned how to create a full stack web application from start to finish.

## Project Details

I learned the following from this tutorial:
1. The Express Web Framework
2. How to setup a Node development environment
3. Using a database to store my app's data
4. How to setup a CRUD interface for a web app
5. MVC architecture
6. Working with forms
7. Deploying my app to production

I used the following technologies to complete my app:
- Node.js - javascript runtime
- Express - web application framwork
- EJS - plain javascript templating language
- MongoDB - NoSQL databse
- Heroku - cloud platform as a service
- Git - version control system

While this tutorial had detailed explanations and provided the code to build the core components of the local library application, I implemented the following functionalities on my own:
- Deleting a book
- Updating an author
- Deleting a genre
- Updating a genre
- Deleting a book instance
- Updating a book instance
- Formatting the date for user input

I used the following resources to help me create this:
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/introduction-to-express)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website)
